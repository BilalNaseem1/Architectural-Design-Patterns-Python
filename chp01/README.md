The first part of the book looks at how to build a rich object model through TDD i.e. Test Driven Deployment

1. Business Logic Layer = Domain Model = problem which we are solving

### Simple Explanation with Example

**What is a Domain Model?**

A **domain model** is a way to **describe and structure the real-world problem you're trying to solve** in software. It lives at the **core (business logic layer)** of your application and captures **how the business works** in terms of rules, behaviors, and concepts.

### üí° **Real-World Analogy: Pizza Delivery App**

Imagine you're building a **Pizza Delivery App**.

* The **domain** here is everything related to pizza ordering: customers, pizzas, ingredients, delivery, payments, etc.
* The **domain model** is how you **represent and manage that domain in your code**.

#### Example:

You might create Python classes like:

```python
class Pizza:
    def __init__(self, size, toppings):
        self.size = size
        self.toppings = toppings

class Order:
    def __init__(self, customer, pizza):
        self.customer = customer
        self.pizza = pizza
        self.status = "Preparing"

    def mark_delivered(self):
        self.status = "Delivered"
```

This is your **domain model**. It captures:

* What a pizza is (size, toppings)
* What an order is (customer, pizza, delivery status)
* What business rules exist (e.g., how to change status)

### ‚úÖ Why It's Useful

* It helps developers and business people **speak the same language**.
* It makes your software more **aligned with the real-world problem**.
* It separates the **core logic** from user interfaces or databases.

### Summary

| Term         | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain       | The **business area** you're working in (e.g., pizza delivery)          |
| Model        | A **simplified representation** of something (e.g., classes or objects) |
| Domain Model | Your **code's representation** of the real-world business logic         |

It‚Äôs the **mental map of your business turned into code**.

Sure! Here's a **simplified explanation with a relatable example** to help you understand the concept being explained.

### üöõ Example: Buying a Sofa Online

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre buying a **sofa** from an online furniture store.

Previously, the store only showed sofas as **"in stock"** if they were **already sitting in the warehouse**. If they ran out, the item would be marked **"out of stock"** until the next shipment arrived.

---

### üí° New Business Idea

Now, the company wants to improve sales by changing how stock is shown:

> Instead of waiting for sofas to arrive in the warehouse, **they‚Äôll also show the sofas that are still on the ship** from China, Poland, or Vietnam as **available to order**‚Äîjust with longer delivery times.

This means:

* Fewer products show as ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù
* Customers can still place orders
* The company can hold less inventory in the local warehouse (saving money)

---

### üîÑ Why It‚Äôs Not So Simple

Before, allocating an order just meant:

> ‚ÄúSubtract 1 sofa from the warehouse stock.‚Äù

Now, it has to:

* Check **warehouse stock**
* Check **incoming shipments**
* Decide **which batch** of stock (existing or incoming) should be assigned to which customer order

This new logic is more complex, so we need a **better way to model** the rules and process ‚Äî that's where **domain modeling** comes in.

---

### üß† What‚Äôs Domain Modeling Here?

It‚Äôs about **understanding and mapping**:

* What is a "batch" of stock?
* What rules decide **how orders get assigned** to batches?
* What happens if two customers try to buy the same sofa from an incoming shipment?

We talk to business experts, gather real examples, and build a **shared language** to represent these ideas in code.

Example concept from this model:

```python
class Batch:
    def __init__(self, ref, product, quantity, eta):
        self.ref = ref          # Batch reference (like SHIP123)
        self.product = product  # e.g., "SOFA_RED"
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.eta = eta          # Estimated Time of Arrival

class OrderLine:
    def __init__(self, orderid, product, quantity):
        self.orderid = orderid
        self.product = product
        self.quantity = quantity
```

### ‚úÖ Why Domain Modeling Matters

It helps everyone (developers + business) understand:

* What‚Äôs happening
* Why decisions are made a certain way
* How the business rules translate into real software

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old System      | Only used warehouse stock for orders                                |
| New System      | Includes stock on incoming shipments                                |
| Domain Modeling | Maps out this new process with clear rules and shared understanding |
